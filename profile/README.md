Virtualization is an enabling technology for creating important new system abstractions and addressing the various challenges faced by today's computing systems. Autonomics are the key to handling the ever-increasing complexity in the computing systems by automatically managing and optimizing the systems. The fundamental goal of the VISA Research Lab is to explore innovative techniques in virtualization and autonomics in order to effectively utilize the resources in large-scale, dynamic, and complex computing systems and to support the efficient, robust, and secure computing of challenging applications from different domains. Currently, our team is focusing on the projects related to cloud computing, high-performance computing, and big data as well as operating systems and storage systems in general.

We are looking for talented and self-motivated graduate and undergraduate students to join us and work on exciting research problems in leading-edge computer systems, including cloud, big data, HPC, and mobile systems. Students with strong systems knowledge and implementation skills (C/Java programming, Linux/Android kernel development, etc.) would be preferred.

ASU is a top research university, recently ranked #1 as the most innovative school by U.S. News. ASU computer science is also a top program, ranked #22 by U.S. News. We are located in a vibrant college town (Tempe) with the convenience provided by a major metropolitan city (Phoenix). We are not far from all the high-tech opportunities on the west coast, and yet our cost of living is quite affordable.

Full scholarships with competitive stipends are available to qualified students.If you are interested in these opportunities, please email [Dr Ming Zhao](mingzhao@asu.edu) with your resume. Students from CS, EE, Automation and other relevant fields are all welcome to apply.
